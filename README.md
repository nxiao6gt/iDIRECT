# iDIRECT - Inference of Direct and Indirect Relationships with Effective Copula-based Transitivity
Networks are vital tools for understanding and modeling interactions in complex 
systems in science and engineering, and direct and indirect interactions are 
pervasive in all types of networks. However, quantitatively disentangling direct 
and indirect relationships in networks remains a formidable task. Here, we 
present a framework, called iDIRECT (Inference of Direct and Indirect 
Relationships with Effective Copula-based Transitivity), for quantitatively 
inferring direct dependencies in association networks. Using copula-based 
transitivity, iDIRECT eliminates/ameliorates several challenging mathematical 
problems, including ill-conditioning, selflooping, and interaction strength 
overflow.

With simulation data as benchmark examples, iDIRECT showed high prediction 
accuracies. Application of iDIRECT to reconstruct gene regulatory networks in 
*Escherichia coli* also revealed considerably higher prediction power than the 
bestperforming approaches in the DREAM5 (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering 
Assessment and Methods project, #5) Network Inference Challenge. In addition, 
applying iDIRECT to highly diverse grassland soil microbial communities in 
response to climate warming showed that the iDIRECT-processed networks were 
significantly different from the original networks, with considerably fewer 
nodes, links, and connectivity, but higher relative modularity. Further analysis 
revealed that the iDIRECT-processed network was more complex under warming than 
the control and more robust to both random and target species removal (*P* < 
0.001).

As a general approach, iDIRECT has great advantages for network inference, and 
it should be widely applicable to infer direct relationships in association 
networks across diverse disciplines in science and engineering.

Please email <naijia.xiao@ou.edu> for questions regarding the program.

## Module Usage
The main functions for iDIRECT is included in the script `idirect.pyc`, with 
auxiliary functions in the scripts `file_handler.pyc` and `net_handler.pyc`. A 
demonstration script `demo.py` is included as a minimal example.

The default `.pyc` files are compiled from Python 3.8.6. If your Python version
is different, please replace the default `.pyc` files with the corresponding
files from `versions/x.x/`, where `x.x` is your Python version number. For
example, if your Python version is 3.9.5, please copy `.pyc` files from
`versions/3.9/`. If your Python version is not available, please email
<naijia.xiao@ou.edu> to request an update.

The modules can be imported by
```
import idirect as idir
import file_handler as fh
import net_handler as nh
```

For debugging purpose, the program starting time is recorded
```
from time import time
t0 = time()
```

The observed total association network is read from the file `result/demo.txt` 
as a list of weighted edges
```
G,n = fh.read_file_weighted_edges("result/demo.txt", t0)
```
The content of the file `result/demo.txt` is shown below
```
N1	N2	0.7
N2	N3	0.7
N1	N3	0.5
```
The observed total association network G is saved as a dictionary of 
dictionaries
```
>>> G
{'N1': {'N2': 0.7, 'N3': 0.5}, 'N2': {'N1': 0.7, 'N3': 0.7}, 'N3': {'N2': 0.7, 'N1': 0.5}}
```

Then iDIRECT is called to calculate the direct association network
```
S,err = idir.direct_association(G, t0=t0)
```
The direct association network S is also saved as a dictionary of dictionaries
```
>>> S
{'N1': {'N2': 0.6963451220087373, 'N3': 0.055394034573921835}, 'N2': {'N1': 0.6963451220087373, 'N3': 0.6963451220087373}, 'N3': {'N2': 0.6963451220087373, 'N1': 0.055394034573921835}}
```

The direct association network is merged with the total association network and 
the edges are extracted as a list of tuples containing the source, target, and 
weight of each edge
```
S2 = nh.merge(G, S)
St = fh.save_sorted_turple(S2, in_file="result/demo.txt")
```
The purpose is to retain the same number of edges as the original observed total 
network as required by the DREAM5 network inference challenge. For this demo 
example, it has no effect
```
>>> S2
{'N1': {'N2': 0.6963451220087373, 'N3': 0.055394034573921835}, 'N2': {'N1': 0.6963451220087373, 'N3': 0.6963451220087373}, 'N3': {'N2': 0.6963451220087373, 'N1': 0.055394034573921835}}
>>> St
[('N1', 'N2', 0.6963451220087373), ('N2', 'N3', 0.6963451220087373), ('N1', 'N3', 0.055394034573921835)]
```

Finally, the direct association network is saved in the file 
`result/demo_res.txt`
```
fh.save_file_weighted_edges(St, "result/demo_res.txt")
```
The content of the output file `result/demo_res.txt` is shown below
```
N1	N2	0.696345122
N2	N3	0.696345122
N1	N3	0.055394035
```
