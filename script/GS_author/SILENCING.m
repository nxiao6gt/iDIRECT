% CODE DESCRIPTION:
% 
% Input: G is a square correlation matrix with diagonal Gii = 1.
% Output: S is the silenced direct dependency matrix. Sii = 0. 
% 
% DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHM:
% 
% Step 1 - PREPROCESSING
% 
%   Checking the singularity of G. If G is singular its off-diagonal terms are
%   renormalized by a factor of Norm (Default: Norm = 0.5).
% 
% Step 2 - SILENCING
% 
%   S is obtained through the silencing transformation
% 
% %        S = Go * inv(G)
% 
%   where Go = G - I + D((G - I)*G).
%   We then obtain the eigenvalues of S (Ls) and test it for 
% 
% %        Max(abs(Ls)) < 1.
% 
%   If S does not follow this condition we renormalize the off-diagonal terms of G
%   until the condition is fulfilled.
%   Below we set the condition to 0.5 < Max(abs(Ls)) < 0.9
%   (Could be set to any valued between 0 and 1)
% 
% Step 3 - POSTPROCESSING
% 
%   Setting diagonal of S to Sii = 0.
%   Setting S to be all positives.
%   Setting maximum value of S to max(S) = 1.
